# Spatial Data Visualizer for Airbnb Listings

## Overview
This project, developed for CS 225 - Spatial Computing, is a web-based application that visualizes Airbnb data to aid users in making informed decisions about their accommodation choices. It utilizes open data from Airbnb to perform exploratory data analysis and presents the results on interactive maps based on user-selected filters. Our custom algorithm ranks these offerings and recommends the best Airbnb based on an analysis of reviews, offering an interactive map with overlays such as the number of listings, prices, hotspots, and availability.

## Features
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize Airbnb listings on interactive maps with overlays for prices, availability, and more.
- **User Filters**: Filter listings based on price, room type, number of bedrooms, and more to find the perfect match.
- **Custom Ranking Algorithm**: Our algorithm ranks listings based on reviews and prices, helping you find the best options.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Folium**: Used for geospatial data visualization on Open Street Maps.
- **Flask**: Serves the web application.
- **Pandas**: Manages and manipulates the data.

## Usage
Upon launching the web application, you can select various filters to adjust the type of Airbnb listings displayed on the map. The map will update dynamically based on your selections to show relevant listings
